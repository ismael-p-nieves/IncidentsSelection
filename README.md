# Incidents Selection

Incidents Selection is a NP-Hard problem that appears in many aspects of business management. Given a set of conditions and the amount of time it would be needed to solve an incident,
we could know which set of incidents will be the most optimal to solve before a time limit.

## About this project

This project was developed during my time at GSyA, a research organization under Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha. I developed this project most of the time by myself, with the occasional help from my tutor at the time.
It was my first real project during my team at this team and it was a helpful way to study and get used to adiabatic computing. This was a problem that has never been solved with Adiabatic Computation, so there were not
any projects or papers to look into. I had to understand the tools that I had available and apply logic and creativity to come up with a new solution.

Along with the adiabatic solution, there is a classic version of this project solved by following a Backtracking algorithm in order to have a Classic algorithm to compare to.

## Competences and soft-skills acquired

- Application of logical thinking and creativeness to come up with a new and never-seen solution.
- Research of an unknown field to get basic understandment of it.
- Research of a new technology in order to understand and utilize it in a real project.
- Proactivity.
